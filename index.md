## Research interests
* Human demographic history through the lens of ancient genomes 
  - Micro scale: especially in relation to the diffustion of cultural traits (e.g., languages, archaeological cultures, domesticated animals/plants)
  - Macro scale: modeling the deep history of modern human
* Local adaptation in relation to demographic history
* Development and adjustment of new statistical genomic methods, especially:
  - Local adaptation signals in admixed populations
  - Coalescent- and haplotype-based methods
